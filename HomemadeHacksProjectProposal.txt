[REQUIRED] Name: Kathryn (Kat) Oltmans
[REQUIRED] Project Title: Homemade Hacks
[REQUIRED] Project Stack: Projects & Algorithms (solo project)
[REQUIRED] GitHub Repo Link: https://github.com/katoltmans/Homemade-Hacks

[REQUIRED] Project Description: Many of us have random household lifehacks that we feel are common sense because we grew up with them, 
but could be a revelation to those outside our circles. I would like to create a site where people can share natural cleaning/pest/household/etc. 
remedies that can be executed with less expensive, natural, everyday materials. I have often looked for natural ideas such as this and found 
individual blogs or articles, but have yet to find a aggregated site where people can add and rate lifehacks that are healthy and less expensive. 
I believe it could be helpful to create a central place to look for these types of tips and tricks.

[REQUIRED] New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: Material UI and how to add form fields on demand (by clicking a button) - add a search bar if time permits - 
I would also like to try to combine what I learned from the two stacks I took and use Python and MongoDB for the back end and React for the front end. (If this is nuts, please let me know.)
I would like to work with my MERN stackmates for the group project if possible, but do not want my Python Skills to get too rusty.
