# Homemade-Hacks

This is a site for users to create and view household tips and tricks using: Python, Flask, React.js, and Material UI

For my individual capstone project, I wanted to create a site where users could share natural, cost-effective household hacks they may have grown up with that is onheard of by others. If we all share those little gems we know, we can work together to make each other's lives a little easier.

This project utilizes webpack to foster comunnication between a Pythonbackend and a React front end. I specifically chose to push myself to mix the stacks I worked with in my bootcamp, understanding that most companies will not follow the standard tech stacks we are taught. One particular challenge I overcame was adding dynamic fields for supplies and instructions to then be saved as a single field in the MySQL backend when creating a hack.
